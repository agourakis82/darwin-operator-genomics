# Results: Dihedral Symmetry Analysis

## Dataset Summary

- **N assemblies**: 200
- **N replicons**: 461
- **Chromosomes**: 0
- **Plasmids**: 0

## Symmetry Statistics (window size = 1000 bp)

### Overall Statistics

- **Mean orbit ratio** (orbit_size / 2n): 1.0 ± 0.0
- **Palindrome fraction**: 0.0%
- **RC-fixed fraction**: 0.0%

### Interpretation

An orbit ratio near 1.0 indicates the sequence has no dihedral symmetry (all rotations and reflections produce distinct sequences). Values < 1.0 indicate symmetry.

- Orbit ratio ≈ 1.0: No detectable symmetry at this window size
- Palindrome fraction: Proportion of windows that read the same forwards and backwards
- RC-fixed fraction: Proportion of windows equal to their reverse complement
