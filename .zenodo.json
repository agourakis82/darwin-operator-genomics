  "title": "Darwin Operator Genomics: Operator Algebras for Genomic Evolution",
  "description": "A computational framework for analyzing genomic sequences through operator algebras, focusing on the dihedral group structure of circular bacterial chromosomes. Implements operators including cyclic shift (S), reverse (R), complement (K), reverse-complement (RC), point mutations (M), and indels (D, I). Includes binary dihedral (dicyclic) group representation as quaternionic embedding.",
