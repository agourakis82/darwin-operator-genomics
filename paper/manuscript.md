## Abstract

We present a computational framework for analyzing genomic sequences through operator algebras, focusing on the dihedral group structure of circular bacterial chromosomes. We implement and test operators including cyclic shift (S), reverse (R), complement (K), reverse-complement (RC), point mutations (M), and indels (D, I), characterizing when the operator set forms a group versus a semigroup. Using complete bacterial genomes from NCBI RefSeq, we quantify symmetry statistics including orbit sizes under dihedral action and fixed-point incidence. We further test a quaternionic representation hypothesis for evolutionary operator chains against Markov baselines, finding that simple quaternionic models do not outperform n-gram predictors on random operator sequences—a negative result preserved for scientific rigor.

## Introduction

Genomic sequences can be viewed through the lens of algebraic structures. For circular chromosomes, the natural symmetry group is the dihedral group D_n, generated by cyclic shifts and reversal. This perspective reveals constraints on sequence evolution and provides a principled framework for canonicalization.

We extend this algebraic view to include:
1. The full dihedral group action on circular DNA
2. Point mutations as relocation-equivariant operators
3. Indels as non-invertible operators that break group closure
4. A speculative quaternionic representation for operator chains

## Methods

### Operator Definitions

Let seq ∈ {A,C,G,T}^n represent a circular DNA sequence of length n.

**Dihedral operators (invertible):**
- S: Cyclic shift, S(seq)_i = seq_{(i+1) mod n}
- R: Reversal, R(seq)_i = seq_{n-i}
- K: Complement, K(seq) maps A↔T, C↔G
- RC = R∘K: Reverse complement

**Mutation operator:**
- M_{p→x}: Point substitution at position p to base x

**Indel operators (non-invertible):**
- D_p: Deletion at position p
- I_{p,x}: Insertion of base x after position p
- V_{a:b}: Segment inversion (reverse-complement of segment)

### Key Identities

The following identities hold:
- R∘R = id (involution)
- K∘K = id (involution)
- S^n = id (n-fold rotation)
- R∘S = S^{-1}∘R (dihedral relation)

Relocation identities for mutations:
- S∘M_{p→x} = M_{(p+1)→x}∘S
- R∘M_{p→x} = M_{(n+1-p)→x}∘R
- K∘M_{p→x} = M_{p→c(x)}∘K (where c is complement)

**Non-invertibility of indels:**
D∘I ≠ id and I∘D ≠ id (information loss)

### Canonicalization

For circular genomes under dihedral action, the canonical representative is:
```
canonical(seq) = min_{k,σ} { σ∘S^k(seq) | k ∈ [0,n), σ ∈ {id, R} }
```

The orbit size ranges from 1 (highly symmetric) to 2n (no symmetry).

### Data Acquisition

Complete bacterial genomes were downloaded from NCBI RefSeq (assembly_summary.txt), filtering for:
- assembly_level = "Complete Genome"
- version_status = "latest"

### Symmetry Analysis

For each replicon, we sampled 100 windows of 1000 bp and computed:
- Orbit size under dihedral action
- Fixed-point indicators for R (palindrome) and RC

### Quaternionic Compression Test

We tested whether quaternion representations improve next-operator prediction:

**Baselines:**
- Markov(1): Bigram transition probabilities
- Markov(2): Trigram transition probabilities

**Quaternion model:**
- Latent state: unit quaternion q ∈ S^3
- Update: q ← q * Q_{op} for operator-specific quaternions Q_{op}
- Prediction: softmax(W·q) for readout matrix W

## Results

### Dataset Summary

*(Generated from results/tables/table1_dataset_summary.csv)*

<!-- INSERT TABLE 1 HERE -->

### Symmetry Statistics

*(See Figure 2 and results/text/results_r1_r2.md)*

<!-- INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE -->

The orbit ratio (orbit_size / 2n) indicates the degree of dihedral symmetry:
- Values near 1.0: No detectable symmetry
- Values < 1.0: Symmetry present

Palindrome and RC-fixed sequences are rare at the 1000 bp window scale, as expected for random-like genomic sequences.

### Quaternionic Compression Hypothesis

*(See Figure 3 and results/text/results_r3.md)*

<!-- INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE -->

**Negative Result:** The quaternion model does not consistently outperform Markov baselines on random operator chains. This suggests that:

1. Simple quaternionic representations lack sufficient capacity
2. Random operator chains lack sequential structure that quaternions might capture
3. The quaternionic hypothesis may require more sophisticated architectures or real evolutionary data

This negative result is preserved for scientific completeness.

## Discussion

We have implemented a complete operator algebra framework for genomic sequences, verified fundamental algebraic identities through unit tests, and demonstrated symmetry analysis on real bacterial genomes.

The quaternionic compression hypothesis, while theoretically motivated by the group structure of dihedral operators, does not yield practical improvements in our random-chain experiments. Future work could explore:

1. **Real evolutionary chains:** Inferring operator sequences from phylogenetic comparisons
2. **Richer representations:** Clifford algebras or neural architectures
3. **Biological priors:** Incorporating known mutation biases and selection pressures

The operator algebra framework itself remains valuable for:
- Canonical representation of circular genomes
- Quantifying sequence symmetry
- Understanding the algebraic structure of evolutionary operators
