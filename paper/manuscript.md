## Abstract

We present a computational framework for analyzing genomic sequences through operator algebras, focusing on the dihedral group structure of circular bacterial chromosomes. We implement operators including cyclic shift (S), reverse (R), complement (K), reverse-complement (RC), point mutations (M), and indels (D, I), characterizing when the operator set forms a group versus a semigroup. Using complete bacterial genomes from NCBI RefSeq, we quantify both exact symmetry (orbit sizes, fixed points) and approximate dihedral self-similarity via a minimum-distance metric with GC-shuffled null baseline. We further develop a binary dihedral (dicyclic) group representation as a structured quaternionic embedding under the double cover SU(2) → SO(3), computationally verifying the 2-to-1 projection property. Testing quaternionic representations for operator chain prediction against Markov baselines yields negative results on random sequences, preserved for scientific rigor.

## Introduction

Genomic sequences can be viewed through the lens of algebraic structures. For circular chromosomes, the natural symmetry group is the dihedral group D_n, generated by cyclic shifts and reversal (Weyl, 1950). This perspective reveals constraints on sequence evolution and provides a principled framework for canonicalization.

The dihedral group D_n of order 2n admits a 2-to-1 lift to the dicyclic (binary dihedral) group Dic_n of order 4n, which embeds naturally into the unit quaternions SU(2) (Conway & Smith, 2003). This lift provides a structured quaternionic representation of genomic operators with mathematical guarantees.

We extend this algebraic view to include:
1. The full dihedral group action on circular DNA with exact and approximate symmetry metrics
2. Point mutations as relocation-equivariant operators
3. Indels as non-invertible operators that break group closure
4. Binary dihedral (dicyclic) representation in unit quaternions with verified double cover property
5. Compression hypothesis tests for quaternionic operator representations

## Methods

### Operator Definitions

Let seq ∈ {A,C,G,T}^n represent a circular DNA sequence of length n.

**Dihedral operators (invertible):**
- S: Cyclic shift, S(seq)_i = seq_{(i+1) mod n}
- R: Reversal, R(seq)_i = seq_{n-i}
- K: Complement, K(seq) maps A↔T, C↔G
- RC = R∘K: Reverse complement

**Mutation operator:**
- M_{p→x}: Point substitution at position p to base x

**Indel operators (non-invertible):**
- D_p: Deletion at position p
- I_{p,x}: Insertion of base x after position p
- V_{a:b}: Segment inversion (reverse-complement of segment)

### Key Identities

The following identities hold:
- R∘R = id (involution)
- K∘K = id (involution)
- S^n = id (n-fold rotation)
- R∘S = S^{-1}∘R (dihedral relation)

Relocation identities for mutations:
- S∘M_{p→x} = M_{(p+1)→x}∘S
- R∘M_{p→x} = M_{(n+1-p)→x}∘R
- K∘M_{p→x} = M_{p→c(x)}∘K (where c is complement)

**Non-invertibility of indels:**
D∘I ≠ id and I∘D ≠ id (information loss)

### Canonicalization and Orbit Size

For circular genomes under dihedral action, the canonical representative is:
```
canonical(seq) = min_{k,σ} { σ∘S^k(seq) | k ∈ [0,n), σ ∈ {id, R} }
```

The orbit size ranges from 1 (highly symmetric) to 2n (no dihedral invariance). An orbit ratio of 1.0 indicates maximal orbit size, which is the expected null for random or typical genomic sequences at kilobase scales.

### Approximate Dihedral Self-Similarity

To quantify partial symmetry beyond exact invariance, we define the minimum dihedral distance:

```
d_min(w) = min_{g ∈ G \ {id}} Hamming(w, g(w))
```

where G = {S^k, R∘S^k | k ∈ [0,n)} ∪ {RC∘S^k} is the extended dihedral action including reverse-complement.

The normalized metric d_min/L ∈ [0, 1] indicates approximate self-similarity:
- d_min/L ≈ 0: Strong approximate invariance under some dihedral transform
- d_min/L ≈ 0.5: No structure beyond random chance

**Null baseline:** For each window, we compute d_min/L on GC-preserving shuffled sequences to establish the expected value under the null hypothesis of no dihedral structure beyond base composition (Karlin & Altschul, 1990).

### Binary Dihedral (Dicyclic) Group Representation

The dicyclic group Dic_n is generated by:
- a: rotation element of order 2n (quaternion form: exp(πi/n))
- b: reflection lift of order 4 (quaternion j)

With relations: a^{2n} = 1, b² = a^n, bab⁻¹ = a⁻¹

This provides a 2-to-1 homomorphism Dic_n → D_n where antipodal quaternions {q, -q} project to the same dihedral element. The dicyclic representation embeds genomic operators in the Lie group SU(2), providing smooth interpolation and geometric structure (Conway & Smith, 2003).

### Data Acquisition

Complete bacterial genomes were downloaded from NCBI RefSeq (O'Leary et al., 2016), filtering for:
- assembly_level = "Complete Genome"
- version_status = "latest"

Download script: `scripts/download_genomes.jl`
Manifest with checksums: `data/cache/manifest.jsonl`

### Statistical Analysis

For symmetry comparisons, we use:
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for distribution differences (real vs shuffled)
- Cohen's d effect size for practical significance
- 95% confidence intervals via bootstrap where appropriate

### Quaternionic Compression Test

We tested whether quaternion representations improve next-operator prediction:

**Baselines:**
- Markov(1): Bigram transition probabilities
- Markov(2): Trigram transition probabilities

**Quaternion model:**
- Latent state: unit quaternion q ∈ S³
- Update: q ← q * Q_{op} for operator-specific quaternions Q_{op}
- Prediction: softmax(W·q) for readout matrix W

**Binary dihedral model:**
- Encode operator chains as dicyclic quaternions using structured generators
- Compare reduced chain lengths in dihedral vs dicyclic representations
- Analyze quaternion state trajectories for random operator sequences

## Results

### Dataset Summary

*(Generated from results/tables/table1_dataset_summary.csv)*

<!-- INSERT TABLE 1 HERE -->

### Exact Symmetry Statistics

*(See Figure 2 and results/text/results_r1_r2.md)*

<!-- INSERT FIGURE 2 HERE -->

The orbit ratio (orbit_size / 2n) indicates exact dihedral invariance:
- **Orbit ratio = 1.0:** Maximal orbit size, no exact dihedral invariance. All 2n group elements produce distinct sequences.
- **Orbit ratio < 1.0:** Some exact symmetry present (e.g., palindrome, periodic sequence).

At 1000 bp window scale, we observe orbit ratio ≈ 1.0 and palindrome/RC-fixed rates ≈ 0%. This is the **expected null** for random-like genomic sequences and does not indicate absence of structure—only absence of *exact* invariance.

### Approximate Dihedral Self-Similarity

*(See results/text/results_approx_symmetry.md)*

The d_min/L metric reveals approximate symmetry below the exact invariance threshold:

| Window Size | d_min/L (Real) | d_min/L (Shuffled) | KS p-value | Effect Size |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|------------|-------------|
| 100 bp      | TBD            | TBD                | TBD        | TBD         |
| 250 bp      | TBD            | TBD                | TBD        | TBD         |
| 500 bp      | TBD            | TBD                | TBD        | TBD         |
| 1000 bp     | TBD            | TBD                | TBD        | TBD         |

*Note: Values populated from analysis run.*

**Interpretation:**
- d_min/L(real) < d_min/L(shuffled): Genomic sequences have more dihedral self-similarity than random
- Effect size > 0.2: Small practical difference; > 0.5: medium; > 0.8: large

### Binary Dihedral (Dicyclic) Representation

*(See Figure 3 and results/text/results_r3.md)*

<!-- INSERT FIGURE 3 HERE -->

**Double cover verification:** For all tested group orders (n = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16), the 2-to-1 projection property is verified: antipodal quaternions {q, -q} map to the same dihedral element.

**Chain reduction analysis:** Random dihedral operator chains reduce to similar lengths in both dihedral and dicyclic representations, as expected since the underlying group structure is preserved.

**Quaternion trajectories:** Under random operator sequences, quaternion states typically remain far from identity, reflecting the non-trivial mixing of the group action. Return-to-identity rates decrease with chain length.

### Quaternionic Compression Hypothesis

**Negative Result:** The quaternion model does not consistently outperform Markov baselines on random operator chains. This suggests that:

1. Simple quaternionic representations lack sufficient capacity for this task
2. Random operator chains lack the sequential structure that quaternions might capture
3. The quaternionic hypothesis may require real evolutionary data or more sophisticated architectures

This negative result is preserved for scientific completeness.

## Discussion

We have implemented a complete operator algebra framework for genomic sequences, verified fundamental algebraic identities through unit tests, and demonstrated both exact and approximate symmetry analysis on real bacterial genomes.

**Key findings:**

1. **Exact invariance is rare:** Orbit ratio ≈ 1.0 at kilobase scales, with essentially zero palindrome/RC-fixed sequences. This is the expected null hypothesis.

2. **Approximate self-similarity:** The d_min/L metric provides a more sensitive measure of dihedral structure, with comparison to GC-shuffled baseline enabling statistical inference.

3. **Binary dihedral representation:** The dicyclic group embedding in SU(2) provides a mathematically rigorous quaternionic representation with verified double cover property.

4. **Compression hypothesis:** Quaternionic models do not outperform n-gram baselines on random chains, suggesting the need for real evolutionary data or richer architectures.

**Future directions:**

1. **Real evolutionary chains:** Inferring operator sequences from phylogenetic comparisons
2. **Richer representations:** Clifford algebras, neural architectures, or equivariant networks
3. **Biological priors:** Incorporating known mutation biases and selection pressures
4. **Scale analysis:** Examining d_min/L across different genomic scales and functional regions

The operator algebra framework remains valuable for:
- Canonical representation of circular genomes
- Quantifying sequence symmetry at multiple levels
- Understanding the algebraic structure of evolutionary operators
